# Recently I had a visit with my mom and we realized that the two digits that make
# up my age when reversed resulted in her age. For example, if she’s 73, I’m 37. We
#
# wondered how often this has happened over the years but we got sidetracked with other
#
# topics and we never came up with an answer.
#
# “When I got home I figured out that the digits of our ages have been reversible six times
#
# so far. I also figured out that if we’re lucky it would happen again in a few years, and
#
# if we’re really lucky it would happen one more time after that. In other words, it would
#
# have happened 8 times over all. So the question is, how old am I now?

# Write a Python program that searches for solutions to this Puzzler. Hint: you might find the string
